[] Figure out round numbers and board size for 2 player game? 12 spaces / 9 rounds seems great for 3, and 12 / 8 seems great for 4. Could a 2 player game be 9 spaces / 10 rounds? But you also have to change the proportion of landscapes and artifacts and number of equipments and stuff. This feels like a kind of radical change?
