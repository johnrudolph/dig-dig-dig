# Overview
## Premise
You are an excavator. You will be digging along side other excavators to explore a grid of spaces. Several clients are offering big rewards in exchange for fulfilling their missions. You'll have to decide which clients to take on in order to earn the most money. 

# Setup
1. Shuffle each set of 12 Landscape cards separately. Create a 4x3 grid of Bedrock facedown. Place a facedown Subsoil on top of each. Then place a Topsoil on top of each.
2. Each player takes a base set of Actioncards, shuffles, and draws 5. Each base set contains: 
     - 2 "Turn Left" cards
     - 2 "Turn Right" cards
     - 1 "Dig 1" card
     - 1 "Dig 2" card
     - 4 "Move 1" cards
3. Shuffle the equipment deck. Draw the top 3 cards and lay them out face-up next to the facedown deck.
4. Shuffle the contracts deck, draw 2, and place them face-up near the play area.
5. Find any special Artifact or Equipment cards from the Contracts
