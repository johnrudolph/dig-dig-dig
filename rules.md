# Overview
## Premise
You are an excavator. You will be digging along side other excavators to explore a grid of spaces. Several clients are offering big rewards in exchange for fulfilling their missions. You'll have to decide which clients to take on in order to earn the most money. The player with the most money at the end of the game wins.

## Components
### Player Tokens
Each player has a Player Token. These represent where the player is on the board, and indicate the direction that the player is facing. 

### Landscapes
The board will start with 3 layers of Landscape cards: Topsoil, Subsoil, and Bedrock. Each Landscape could reveal an Artifact, or grant you new Actions.

### Artifacts
When you discover an Artifact by digging, you will draw the next artifact from the Artifact deck. Artifacts represent rewards that will determine the winner at the end of the game. Many Artifacts also have a special one time effect that happens if you Trash it (permanently remove it from the game).

You can only have 3 Artifacts in your hand at a time. If you ever have more than that, you must drop Artifacts on your space until you are back down to 3.

### Actions
These are the cards that players will use to take their turns. Actions include everything from moving, turning, and digging, to exciting unique actions that will turn you into an elite excavator. 

### Missions
Missions are special requests from clients that offer big rewards. Most Missions will require multiple players to fulfill. A Mission can also include special Actions or Artifacts that get shuffled into those decks.

# Setup
1. Shuffle each set of 12 Landscape cards separately. Create a 4x3 grid of Bedrock face-down. Place a face-down Subsoil on top of each. Then place a Topsoil on top of each.
2. Each player takes a base set of Action cards, shuffles, and draws 5. Each base set contains: 
  - 1 "Turn left" card
  - 1 "Turn right" card
  - 1 "Turn around" card
  - 1 "Dig 1" card
  - 1 "Dig 2" card
  - 5 "Move 1" cards
3. Shuffle the Action deck. Draw the top 3 cards and lay them out face-up next to the face-down deck.
4. Shuffle the Mission deck, draw 2, and place them face-up near the play area. 
5. Find any special Artifact or Action cards from the Missions. Shuffle the special Action cards into the Action deck. Shuffle the normal Artifact deck, and add cards from it to the special Artifact cards until there are 12 total. Set the others aside, shuffle the combined Artifact deck, and set it near the play area.
6. Determine a first player, and hand them the Golden Shovel.
7. Beginning with the first player, each player takes a player token and sets it on any space on the board.

# Gameplay
Dig Dig Dig takes place over a series of rounds. The number of rounds depends on the number of players: 
  - 3 players: 9 rounds
  - 4 players: 8 rounds

Each round consists of two phases: 

### Preparation
Each player draws 5 cards from their deck. Place cards from your hand face-down in a row in front of you to prepare your turn. The cards you prepare will be resolved in the order you place them. 
  - You do not need to use all 5 cards: for any cards you don't use, you may either discard them, or keep them in your hand for later.
  - Each player has their own discard pile, which should always be face-up.

If you plan to Trash one or more of your Artifacts during your turn, place the Artifact face-down in front of your first card. These will always resolve before the other cards.

Players prepare their actions simultaneously. Once all players are ready, move on to the Action phase.

### Action
First, all players reveals and resolves any Artifacts they are trashing. Leave them face-up in the play area as a reminder of their effects on the round. 

Take turns beginning with the player with the Golden Shovel. On your turn, reveal your face-down cards one by one, left to right, resolving each as you reveal it. When you are finished, discard the cards you played, and draw back up to 5.

  - If you ever reveal an Action that you cannot perform, skip it.
  - When your draw pile is empty, shuffle your discard pile and replace it.

There are many Actions, which are specified in the Glossary, but here are a few that are in your base deck, and are important to understand: 

#### Move
Move forward in the direction that you are already facing. Multiple players may occupy the same space. 
  - If you are facing the edge of the board, do nothing. 

#### Turn
Rotate your Player Token in the direction specified by the Action card.

#### Dig
From the space your Player Token is on, pick up the number of Landscape cards specified on the Dig card. If the Landscape card reveals an Artifact, draw an Artifact card and add it to your inventory

  - You may only hold 3 Artifacts at a time. You may drop Artifacts at any time by placing it face-down on your space. If there are face-down Artifacts on your space, you may look at them and pick them up on your turn.

If the Landscape card has nothing on it, you may select a new Action card to add to your deck. 

  - You may choose any of the 3 face-up Actions and immediately replace it with the top card from the Action deck. Or you may take the top Action from the deck.

Remove the Landscape cards you revealed from the game.

#### Accept a Contract
Finally, there is one special thing you can do during your turn. Once per game, you may pick up the Contracts deck, and select one card to keep facedown for the rest of the game. You can only have 1 Contract. 

### Pass the Shovel

Once all players have revealed their prepared cards, pass the Gold Shovel to the left, and return to the Preparation phase.

## Game End

Once you have completed all rounds (9 rounds for a 3 player game, 8 for a 2 player game), the game is over. All players reveal their Artifacts and Contracts.

### Resolve Missions
Determine whether each Mission was successful. Each player reveals their Contract card. If their Mission was successful, they receive the Mission reward. If two players have the Contract for that Mission, they must split the reward.

If you have the Spoiler Contract, you receive reward if neither Mission was successful.

### Count other Artifacts
Each player adds to their score the value of the other Artifacts in their inventory. 

### Determine a winner
The player with the most
